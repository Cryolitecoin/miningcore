### Supported Coins

Refer to [this file](https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/blob/master/src/Miningcore/coins.json) for a complete list.

#### Ethereum

Miningcore implements the [Ethereum stratum mining protocol](https://github.com/nicehash/Specifications/blob/master/EthereumStratum_NiceHash_v1.0.0.txt) authored by NiceHash. This protocol is implemented by all major Ethereum miners.

- Claymore Miner must be configured to communicate using this protocol by supplying the <code>-esm 3</code> command line option
- Genoil's ethminer must be configured to communicate using this protocol by supplying the <code>-SP 2</code> command line option

#### ZCash

- Pools needs to be configured with both a t-addr and z-addr (new configuration property "z-address" of the pool configuration element)
- First configured zcashd daemon needs to control both the t-addr and the z-addr (have the private key)
- To increase the share processing throughput it is advisable to increase the maximum number of concurrent equihash solvers through the new configuration property "equihashMaxThreads" of the cluster configuration element. Increasing this value by one increases the peak memory consumption of the pool cluster by 1 GB.
- Miners may use both t-addresses and z-addresses when connecting to the pool

### Runtime Requirements on Windows

- [.Net Core 2.1 Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
- [PostgreSQL Database](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Coin Daemon (per pool)

### Runtime Requirements on Linux

- [.Net Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
- [PostgreSQL Database](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Coin Daemon (per pool)
- Miningcore needs to be built from source on Linux. Refer to the section further down below for instructions.

### Running pre-built Release Binaries on Windows

- Download miningcore-win-x64.zip from the latest [Release](https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/releases)
- Extract the Archive
- Setup the database as outlined below
- Create a configuration file <code>config.json</code> as described [here](https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/wiki/Configuration)
- Run <code>dotnet Miningcore.dll -c config.json</code>

### PostgreSQL Database setup

Create the database:

```console
$ createuser miningcore
$ createdb miningcore
$ psql (enter the password for postgres)
```

Run the query after login:

```sql
alter user miningcore with encrypted password 'some-secure-password';
grant all privileges on database miningcore to miningcore;
```

Import the database schema:

```console
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/master/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb.sql
$ psql -d miningcore -U miningcore -f createdb.sql
```

### [API](https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/wiki/API)

### Building from Source

#### Building on Ubuntu 16.04

```console
$ wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
$ sudo apt-get update -y
$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https -y
$ sudo apt-get update -y
$ sudo apt-get -y install dotnet-sdk-2.1 git cmake build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config libboost-all-dev libsodium-dev libzmq5
$ git clone https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore
$ cd miningcore/src/Miningcore
$ dotnet publish -c Release --framework netcoreapp2.1  -o ../../build
```

#### Building on Windows

Download and install the [.Net Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)

```dosbatch
> git clone https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore
> cd miningcore/src/Miningcore
> dotnet publish -c Release --framework netcoreapp2.1  -o ..\..\build
```

#### Building on Windows - Visual Studio

- Download and install the [.Net Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
- Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/). Visual Studio Community Edition is fine.
- Open `Miningcore.sln` in VS 2017


#### After successful build

Create a configuration file <code>config.json</code> as described [here](https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/wiki/Configuration)

```
cd ../../build
dotnet Miningcore.dll -c config.json
```

## Running a production pool

A public production pool requires a web-frontend for your users to check their hashrate, earnings etc. Miningcore does not include such frontend but there are several community projects that can be used as starting point.
